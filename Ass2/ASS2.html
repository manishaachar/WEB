    <h1>History of painting:</h1>
    <p style="color: rgb(118, 118, 200) ; font-style: oblique; font-size: x-large;">The history of painting reaches back in time to artifacts and artwork created by pre-historic artists, and spans all cultures. It represents a continuous, though periodically disrupted, tradition from Antiquity. Across cultures, continents, and millennia, the history of painting consists of an ongoing river of creativity that continues into the 21st century.[1] Until the early 20th century it relied primarily on representational, religious and classical motifs, after which time more purely abstract and conceptual approaches gained favor.</p>
    <h2>Rock art</h2>   
    <p>Rock art of India includes rock relief carvings, engravings and paintings, some (but by no means all) from the South Asian Stone Age.. It is estimated there are about 1300 rock art sites with over a quarter of a million figures and figurines.[1] The earliest rock carvings in India were discovered by Archibald Carlleyle, twelve years before the Cave of Altamira in Spain,[2] although his work only came to light much later via J Cockburn (1899).[3]</p>
    <h2>Indus Valley Civilization (c. 3300 BC – c. 1750 BC)</h2>
    <p>Despite its widespread and sophistication, the Indus Valley civilization seems to have taken no interest in public large-scale art, unlike many other early civilizations. A number of gold, terracotta and stone figurines of girls in dancing poses reveal the presence of some forms of dance. Additionally, the terracotta figurines included cows, bears, monkeys, and dogs.</p>
